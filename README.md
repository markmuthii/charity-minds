# Charity Minds

Charity Minds is a collaborative platform developed during our bootcamp to promote equitable distribution of charity to children's homes. The application allows different groups to log the homes they have visited, enabling others to identify homes that have not yet received visits. This ensures that all homes receive the support they need.

## Features

- Log visits to children's homes.
- View a list of homes that have been visited.
- Identify homes that require attention.

## Purpose

The primary goal of Charity Minds is to ensure that charity efforts are evenly distributed across various children's homes, preventing some homes from being overlooked while others receive repeated visits.

## How to Use

1. Register or log in to the platform.
2. Indicate the children's homes you have visited.
3. Browse the list of homes to identify those that need support.

## Future Enhancements

- Add a map view to visualize the locations of children's homes.
- Enable notifications for homes that have not been visited in a while.
- Provide analytics on charity distribution trends.
